1. File Structure:-

2022322_Q1(a)_NikhilKumar.py: It contains the Code for the question 1, in which we have to find the bugs and fill the code for the global alignment. 
2022322_Q1(b)_NikhilKumar.py: It contains the Code for the question 1, in which we have to find all the optimal alignment for global alignment. The difference between 2022322_Q1(a)_NikhilKumar.py and 2022322_Q1(b)_NikhilKumar.py is that in 2022322_Q1(a)_NikhilKumar.py we only find one optimal alignment whereas in 2022322_Q1(b)_NikhilKumar.py we find all the optimal alignments.
2022322_Q2_NikhilKumar.py: It contains the Code for the question 2, in which we have to perform the local alignment of two sequences.

2. I have well commented my code in the code file only using multiline comments. And have explained the whole logic too.
